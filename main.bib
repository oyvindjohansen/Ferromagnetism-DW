    abstract = {{In 1955, a phenomenological theory of ferromagnetism was well established and had been corroborated by a considerable amount of experimental data. However, there were problems in the phenomenological theory of the dynamics of the magnetization field. The Landau-Lifshitz equation for damping of the motion of the magnetization field could not account for the large noneddy-current damping in thin Permalloy sheets. The problem undertaken herein is a reformulation of the theory in a way that is more consistent with the theory of damping in other physical systems in order to be able to take large damping into account.}},
