    abstract = {{Skyrmions are topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties that play an important role in various fields of science. Recently, skyrmions have been observed to be stabilized by an external magnetic field in bulk magnets. Here, we describe a two-dimensional square lattice of skyrmions on the atomic length scale as the magnetic ground state of a hexagonal Fe film of one-atomic-layer thickness on the Ir(111) surface. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we develop a spin model on a discrete lattice that identifies the interplay of Heisenberg exchange, the four-spin and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction as the microscopic origin of this magnetic state.}},

This Berry phase constitutes the gauge fields, i.e. the emergent electromagnetic fields in solids, and affects the motion of the electrons. In momentum space, the band crossings act as the magnetic monopoles, i.e. the sources or sinks of the gauge flux. In real space, the spin textures with non-coplanar spin configurations produce the gauge field by the solid angle leading to the spin chirality. Skyrmion is the representative structure supporting this gauge field. A typical phenomenon reflecting this gauge field is the anomalous Hall effect, i.e. the Hall effect produced by the spontaneous magnetization combined with the relativistic spin{\textendash}orbit interaction. We discuss a few examples recently studied related to these issues with some new results on skyrmion formation.},

Skyrmions have been observed both by means of neutron scattering in momentum space and microscopy techniques in real space, and their properties include novel Hall effects, current-driven motion with ultralow current density and multiferroic behaviour. These properties can be understood from a unified viewpoint, namely the emergent electromagnetism associated with the non-coplanar spin structure of skyrmions. From this description, potential applications of skyrmions as information carriers in magnetic information storage and processing devices are envisaged.},
