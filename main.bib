  abstract={Oscillatory effects in a strong magnetic field B and magnetic susceptibility are investigated, as applied to 2D systems, in which the twofold spin degeneracy is lifted by the spin-orbit-interaction Hamiltonian H SO = alpha ( sigma *k). nu . The term H SO is shown to change greatly the usual patterns of B -1 -periodic oscillations; some oscillations are strongly suppressed due to the diminishing of the gaps between adjacent levels, and new oscillations appear due to intersections of levels.}

    abstract = {{In 1955, a phenomenological theory of ferromagnetism was well established and had been corroborated by a considerable amount of experimental data. However, there were problems in the phenomenological theory of the dynamics of the magnetization field. The Landau-Lifshitz equation for damping of the motion of the magnetization field could not account for the large noneddy-current damping in thin Permalloy sheets. The problem undertaken herein is a reformulation of the theory in a way that is more consistent with the theory of damping in other physical systems in order to be able to take large damping into account.}},
